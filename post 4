<h2>Understanding Manga and Anime</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anime and manga are two different types of Japanese media that have taken the world by storm. While they both originate from Japan, they have different styles and content. Anime is a type of animation that often has more complex stories and plots, while manga is a type of comic that is usually more simplistic. Even though they are different, they both have inspired many different aspects of popular culture, including fashion and design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anime designs often feature bright colors and exaggerated features, while manga designs are more subdued and realistic. However, both styles have influenced the way people dress and accessorize all over the world. For example, it is not uncommon to see people wearing shirts with anime characters on them, or people with manga-inspired tattoos. In addition, many fashion designers have been inspired by the unique style of anime and manga when creating their own clothing lines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no doubt that anime and manga have had a profound impact on the world of fashion and design. As more and more people become exposed to these Japanese media, it is likely that we will see even more manga and anime-inspired fashion and design in the future. Who knows, maybe one day everyone will be wearing clothes inspired by their favorite manga or anime character!</p>

<h2>Graphic Design</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anime has also had a big influence on the world of graphic design. Many designers have been incorporating anime-inspired elements into their work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One popular way to do this is through the use of vector graphics. Vector graphics are images that are created using mathematical formulas instead of pixels.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This allows for very clean and sharp lines, which is something that is often associated with anime. Many designers use vector graphics to create anime-inspired illustrations and logos.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some popular graphic designers who have incorporated anime into their work include: Takashi Murakami, Junji Ito and Hayao Miyazaki. All of these artists have been heavily influenced by anime and have used it as a major source of inspiration for their work.</p>
