<h3><strong>Anime fashion trends</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are essentially two main types of common&nbsp;<em>Anime&nbsp;</em>inspired fashion. The first one being closer to&nbsp;<em>cosplay</em>, with fans dressing up like their favorite characters. This includes people wearing capes and robes or other eccentric pieces. On the other hand you have fans symbolizing their favourite anime characters - maybe with an accessory, or maybe with regular streetwear essentials like converse, T-shirts, hats, ties, etc. These types of outfits are most commonly worn in informal settings like shopping streets, restaurants, or meetups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As popular as it is becoming in Japan,&nbsp;<em>anime&nbsp;</em>inspired fashion is facing some serious backlash. Many believe that&nbsp;<em>anime&nbsp;</em>fashion is against the typically accepted Japanese culture. That said, it’s easier for&nbsp;<em>anime&nbsp;</em>lovers to identify other fellow&nbsp;<em>anime&nbsp;</em>lovers when they see others wearing an outfit or using an accessory featuring their favourite show or character. Thus, it helps in socialising with other like-minded people. That’s never a bad thing!</p>
